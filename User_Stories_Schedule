  Outdated user stories (wrong format) :
  //Allow the creation of pairs (from two URLS) and a title/comment + category (possibly source names too.) 
  
  // Record user’s stats on articles’ read based on bias, their prefered topic, and possibly more.     
  
  // The ability to upvote (like) or downvote (dislike) an article pair. 
  
  // The ability to search for article pairs by source, name or bias. 
  
  // The ability to sort/filter article pairs based on their source (or bias) and/or name.
  
  // Viewing Pairs.
  
  // Viewing Pair list
  
  // Viewing Source list
  
  // Viewing stats
  
  // The ability to share pairs with peers via email or text message. 
  
  // Sending user stats. 
  
  // Allow users to specify political biases of sources rating source left/right.
